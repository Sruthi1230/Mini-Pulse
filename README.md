# Mini-Pulse
## IDEA Custom surveys created by user. These surveys can be responded by audience and results will be reported.

## SURVEY TEMPLATE 
the survey will have three different quesion types:

1.  Textbox
2.  Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
3.  Checkbox

## DETAILS 
The code will be written in Java. The idea is to create a custom survey so the audience response will be reported only with a built http server(RESTful recommended). The database will be MYSQL but will be accessed through JDBC.

### NOTE: 
This repository will be updated regularly. PRs from contributers are greatlyÂ appreciated.
